# Project 1: Create Your Identity on Bitcoin Core

## Project Overview
In this project, you’ll create and manage your blockchain identity using a bitcoin wallet.
Using your wallet, you will generate a new wallet address and use your wallet address to sign a message with your private key securely. Next, validate your message with your message signature using our web service.

## Why this project?
This project introduces you to the fundamentals of blockchain technology. Using your wallet, to understand how transactions and security are handled on the blockchain is a substantial first step toward developing your secure applications. Later in this program, you’ll be programming blockchain technologies that utilize these same features.

## What will I learn?
You will learn to create and manage your personal blockchain identity. You’ll get the first-hand experience generating a wallet address and interacting with a web service to create your blockchain identity.
You will apply these skills using real-world technologies to get hands-on with the tools used to manage blockchain transactions and identities.

## How does this help my career?
Understanding wallet and web service interactions using a wallet address will help you build user applications later in the program. Secure and anonymous transactions like these are at the core of all blockchain technologies.
