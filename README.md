# Blockchain_Developer-Udacity_Nanodegree
The goal of this program is to teach me the necessary skills to become a blockchain developer It starts by teaching the fundamentals of the blockchain technology and create your my own private blockchain. It teaches the basics of bitcoin platform and how to secure a digital asset using blockchain identity. Then gain deeper understanding of Ethereum platform, and useing Solidity to develop, test and deploy my own  decentralized app. The program also helps to build on blockchain skills with advanced topics such as privacy, security, payments, and oracles on blockchain. Architect and build complex systems on blockchain for different use cases such as supply chain tracking, insurance payments and decentralized marketplace

# Projects

## Create Your Own Private Blockchain  
A blockchain is a shared database that features added immutability as a safe and accurate alternative to  existing data storage methods. You’ll learn the basics of how the blockchain data model works by creating  your own private blockchain using Node.js and Leveldb. In this project, you’ll learn the fundamentals of architecting a collection of data into a blockchain data model.  
You'll configure how each block stores data, validate blocks, add new blocks to the chain, and create  methods to validate the chain integrity.You'll then create a back-end API web service, and migrate your private blockchain to the web service. In the process, you'll learn how to post new blocks to the blockchain via a RESTful web client. You’ll then encrypt  and decrypt the unique digital collectibles on a private blockchain 

## Build CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum   
With this project, your focus moves from Bitcoin to Ethereum blockchain. You’ll begin by building a decentralized app (Dapp) that allows you to create, sell, and transfer ownership of unique star token  (CryptoStar) on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts and the non-fungible (ERC721) token  standard. This service is designed to demonstrate how to claim and transfer ownership of unique digital  asset ( e.g. document, deed, agreement, media, etc.) on Ethereum blockchain. You’ll build the back-end infrastructure for the CryptoStar with a pre-developed front end. This will enable  you to render the service on any modern web clients. 

## Ethereum Dapp for Tracking Items through Supply  Chain
By the completion of Project 2, you’ll have learned the importance of Proof of Existence, which is used to  verify whether a digital asset is authentic and can be trusted. In this project, you’ll scale up to architect a  solution that verifies authenticity for a product when multiple actors are involved.    
You’ll build a supply chain system on Ethereum blockchain that allows users to verify the authenticity of an  item as it passes through different hands. You will architect a Dapp (Decentralized Application) authenticity  management system backed by the Ethereum platform. To do so, you’ll scope out the needs of the various  actors in the supply chain and create smart contracts that help track product origination and verify product  authenticity. You’ll then tie this all together with a simple front-end that allows users to manage the product  life-cycle as the product moves through the supply chain. 

##  Flight Delay Insurance Dapp   
In the real-world, many smart contracts perform actions based on external triggers. These triggers can be  caused by our actions, or by data received from outside sources using what are known as “oracles.” To make  real-world decentralized applications, smart contracts need to respond autonomously to these triggers,  thereby making these applications more interactive. 
In this project, you'll build a decentralized application for a use case in which you have airlines that offer  flight delay insurance, and passengers who carry this insurance, and who get paid in the event their flight is  delayed. You’ll build multiple smart contracts which are autonomously triggered by external sources, and  which handle payments based on flight delay scenarios. 

## Capstone Project  
Here, you’ll use all the new skills you’ve acquired to build decentralized property listing application.    
In this project, you will represent your ownership of the property using ZK-SNARKs and then mint tokens to  represent your claim to the property. You will then make these tokens available for sale on blockchain  marketplace.
